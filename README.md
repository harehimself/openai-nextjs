   This repository showcases the integration of OpenAI's powerful language models with Next.js, a popular React framework for building server-rendered and static web applications. By combining the strengths of both technologies, developers can create intelligent and interactive user experiences with cutting-edge natural language processing capabilities. The project aims to provide a comprehensive example and guide for seamlessly incorporating OpenAI's API into Next.js applications, enabling developers to harness the potential of advanced language models in their web projects.
